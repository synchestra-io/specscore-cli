**Status:** Stable

## Summary

`specscore idea` commands manage SpecScore Idea artifacts — pre-spec, lintable one-pagers stored at `spec/ideas/<slug>.md`. The group covers scaffolding (`idea new`) and lifecycle transitions (`idea change-status`), each producing or maintaining lint-clean output.

## Problem

Ideas have a strict required-sections contract defined by the [idea](../../idea/README.md) feature. Hand-authoring them means remembering HMW framing, `Not Doing` entries, owner attribution, and status rules. A scaffolder produces a skeleton that is lint-clean on creation, so authors edit content rather than fight structure.

## Contents

| Directory | Description |
|---|---|
| [change-status/](change-status/README.md) | Transition an Idea's status per the legal-transition matrix; `--to=archived` also relocates the file under `spec/ideas/archived/` |
| [new/](new/README.md) | Scaffold a new Idea artifact at `spec/ideas/<slug>.md` |
| [relocate/](relocate/README.md) | Move an Idea or sidekick-seed artifact across SpecScore-managed repos, with cross-repo link cleanup and per-repo auto-commit |

### change-status

Transitions an Idea per the kind's legal-transition matrix: `Draft → Approved`, and any active status → `Archived`. The `--to=archived` path additionally moves the file from `spec/ideas/<slug>.md` to `spec/ideas/archived/<slug>.md` (rollback covers both rewrite and relocation; collision exits `1`). Implements the [lifecycle-transitions](../lifecycle-transitions/README.md) shared contract. Illegal `(from, to)` pairs — including re-running on the target status — exit `4` (InvalidTransition).

### new

Creates a lint-clean Idea skeleton with every required section, HTML-comment prompts describing what belongs in each, and either flag-supplied or interactively prompted content for the core fields (title, HMW, owner, not-doing entries).

### relocate

Moves an Idea or sidekick-seed artifact from the current project to a different SpecScore-managed repo. Auto-resolves slug to `spec/ideas/<slug>.md` first, then `spec/ideas/seeds/<slug>.md`. Pre-flight clean-tree check across source, target, and every sibling SpecScore repo whose docs reference the artifact. Copies the file (with `synchestra-io/*` → `specscore/*` and "this repo" rewrites), updates markdown-link references to the new location across all affected repos, auto-commits per repo by default (`--no-commit` flag stages without committing). Stop-on-first-commit-failure semantics; cross-repo rollback is the user's responsibility.

## Behavior

### Scope of this group

Commands under `specscore idea` operate on a single Idea artifact at `spec/ideas/<slug>.md`. They MUST NOT create features — `feature new` is the entry point for features, and this split keeps the two flows discoverable.

#### REQ: ideas-only

No subcommand of `specscore idea` may mutate `spec/features/`. The canonical write target for this group is `spec/ideas/`.

### Lint-clean output

Every artifact scaffolded under this group MUST pass `specscore spec lint` on first creation.

#### REQ: lint-clean-on-create

A file produced by any `specscore idea` mutation command MUST satisfy every lint rule applicable to the Idea document kind. Commands that cannot produce a lint-clean artifact for the given inputs (e.g., a bad slug) MUST exit with a failure code BEFORE writing the file.

## Interaction with Other Features

| Feature | Interaction |
|---|---|
| [idea](../../idea/README.md) | Defines the required shape of an Idea. `idea new` produces instances. |
| [feature/new](../feature/new/README.md) | Sibling scaffolder for features. Lives in the `feature` group because features are queried there too. |
| [CLI](../README.md) | Inherits shared exit-code contract, `--project`, `--format`. |
| [`idea/` skill](https://github.com/synchestra-io/ai-plugin-specscore/blob/main/skills/idea/SKILL.md) (ai-plugin-specscore) | Agent-side wrapper for `idea new`. Treats this feature spec as the authoritative contract. |

## Open Questions

- Should `specscore idea` grow read commands (`idea list`, `idea info`) symmetric with `feature list` / `feature info`, or does the index in `spec/ideas/README.md` (maintained by `spec lint --fix`) cover the same ground at lower cost?
