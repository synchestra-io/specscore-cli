# Events

SpecScore emits structured events when artifacts change state, when skills
complete, or when a verb explicitly asks the CLI to publish one. This document
describes how events flow and how to configure consumers for your project.

## Overview

Skills and verbs produce events; the `specscore` CLI dispatches each one to a
list of registered subscribers configured in `specscore.yaml`. Built-in
subscriber types cover the common cases (append-to-file, drop-on-the-floor,
and pipe-to-a-child-process), and the dispatcher delivers each envelope to
every configured subscriber in order. Subscriber failures are logged to stderr
but do not stop other subscribers from running. The user-facing entrypoint for
publishing an event is the `specscore event emit` verb (see
[`https://specscore.md/event-emit`](https://specscore.md/event-emit)); the
source-of-truth Feature is
[`spec/features/cli/event/README.md`](../spec/features/cli/event/README.md).

## The events: config block

Subscribers live under a top-level `events:` key in `specscore.yaml`:

```yaml
events:
  subscribers:
    - type: jsonl
      path: .specscore/events.jsonl
    - type: noop
    - type: exec
      name: webhook
      command: ["./bin/forward-to-webhook.sh"]
      timeout_ms: 5000
      env:
        WEBHOOK_URL: https://example.com/hooks/specscore
```

Each entry under `subscribers:` is a mapping. The required `type:` field
selects which built-in subscriber to instantiate; the remaining fields are
type-specific.

| Field         | Applies to       | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`        | all              | One of `jsonl`, `noop`, `exec`. Unknown values are rejected at load time.                                  |
| `path`        | `jsonl`          | File path for appended JSONL output. Relative paths resolve from the project root. Required.               |
| `command`     | `exec`           | Argv list (sequence of strings) for the child process. Must be non-empty.                                  |
| `name`        | `exec`           | Optional human-readable identifier used in stderr failure logs. Defaults to the first argv element.        |
| `timeout_ms`  | `exec`           | Per-event wall-clock budget for the child process, in milliseconds. Defaults to `2000`. Range: `[100, 30000]`. |
| `env`         | `exec`           | Optional mapping of environment variables (string to string) to pass to the child process.                 |

## Built-in subscribers

### jsonl

Appends one event per line to a file in JSONL format. The `path:` field is
resolved relative to the project root, so `path: .specscore/events.jsonl`
writes to `<project>/.specscore/events.jsonl`. Parent directories are created
on first write. This is the default sink synthesized when no `events:` block
is configured.

### noop

Silently discards every event delivered to it. Useful for explicitly turning
off event delivery at the project level without removing the `events:` block.

### exec

Pipes the JSON-encoded envelope to a child process via stdin and waits for it
to exit. The child is considered successful if it exits with status `0`. A
non-zero exit, a crash, or running past `timeout_ms` is reported on stderr.
On timeout the dispatcher sends `SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL` if the process is
still running shortly after. The default timeout is 2000 ms.

## Writing an Exec subscriber

An `exec` subscriber can be any executable on disk. The contract is small:

1. The process receives one line of JSON on stdin: the event envelope.
2. Exit `0` on successful handling; any non-zero exit is treated as failure.
3. Finish within `timeout_ms` (default 2000 ms).

A tiny shell-based webhook forwarder:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/forward-to-webhook.sh
set -euo pipefail
payload="$(cat)"
curl -fsS -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data "$payload" \
  "$WEBHOOK_URL" >/dev/null
```

Wire it in:

```yaml
events:
  subscribers:
    - type: exec
      name: webhook
      command: ["./bin/forward-to-webhook.sh"]
      timeout_ms: 5000
      env:
        WEBHOOK_URL: https://example.com/hooks/specscore
```

The `specscore event emit` verb exits with code `0` on success, `2` on
envelope validation failure, `3` on configuration error, and `10` when one or
more subscribers fail to deliver.

## Envelope shape

Every event delivered to a subscriber is a JSON object with the following
fields. All fields are required.

| Field               | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`              | Dotted event name, e.g. `feature.approved`. Must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*\.[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`.                         |
| `version`           | Positive integer schema version of the event (`>= 1`).                                                               |
| `uuid`              | Lowercase UUID v4 uniquely identifying this emission.                                                                |
| `timestamp`         | RFC 3339 timestamp in UTC (must end with `Z` or `+00:00`).                                                           |
| `actor.kind`        | One of `skill`, `user`, `external`.                                                                                  |
| `actor.id`          | Non-empty string identifying the actor (e.g. skill name, user handle, integration slug).                             |
| `artifact.type`     | One of `idea`, `feature`, `plan`, `task`, `idea-seed`, `consilium-review`.                                           |
| `artifact.id`       | Non-empty string identifying the artifact (typically its slug or ID).                                                |
| `artifact.path`     | Non-empty repo-relative path to the artifact file.                                                                   |
| `artifact.revision` | Non-empty string; the git revision the artifact was read at. The literal value `uncommitted` is permitted.           |
| `payload`           | Free-form JSON object carrying event-specific data. Must parse as a JSON object; the dispatcher does not inspect it. |

Example envelope:

```json
{
  "name": "feature.approved",
  "version": 1,
  "uuid": "7c2d3f5a-9b4e-4a1f-8c2d-1e3a4b5c6d7e",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-22T18:42:11Z",
  "actor": {
    "kind": "user",
    "id": "alexander"
  },
  "artifact": {
    "type": "feature",
    "id": "cli/event",
    "path": "spec/features/cli/event/README.md",
    "revision": "uncommitted"
  },
  "payload": {
    "previous_status": "Under Review",
    "new_status": "Approved"
  }
}
```

## Default behavior

If `specscore.yaml` does not contain an `events:` block (or the file does not
exist), the CLI synthesizes a single `jsonl` subscriber writing to
`.specscore/events.jsonl` relative to the project root. By convention this
file is git-ignored — it is a local audit log, not a checked-in artifact.

## Disabling events

To turn off event delivery entirely, declare an explicit empty subscriber
list:

```yaml
events:
  subscribers: []
```

This differs from omitting the block: an empty list means "the operator opted
in and chose zero subscribers," whereas an absent block falls back to the
default JSONL sink. A single `noop` entry has the same observable effect:

```yaml
events:
  subscribers:
    - type: noop
```
