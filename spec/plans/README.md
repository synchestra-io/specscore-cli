### canonical-grade-metadata-field-cli

Implements the CLI half of the upstream meta-spec
[canonical-grade-metadata-field](https://github.com/specscore/specscore/blob/main/spec/features/canonical-grade-metadata-field/README.md)
Feature: `grade.values` config parsing, header-block parsing of the `**Grade:**`
line (with `--fix` placement normalization), value validation in
`specscore spec lint`, and kind-agnostic / Status-decoupled rule application.
Extends [cli/spec/lint](../features/cli/spec/lint/README.md). Supersedes the
closed trackers specscore-cli#20–23.

### lifecycle-verbs-implementation

Implements the two `change-status` CLI verbs (one per doc kind), the shared `pkg/lifecycle/` package, and the new `feature-index-row-sync` lint rule, parallelizing the work across subagents. Realizes the [lifecycle-verbs-for-idea-and-feature Idea](../ideas/lifecycle-verbs-for-idea-and-feature.md) and the three feature specifications under `spec/features/cli/`.
